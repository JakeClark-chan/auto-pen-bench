# AutoPenBench
This repo contains the codes of the penetration test benchmark for Generative Agents presented in the paper [AutoPenBench: Benchmarking Generative Agents for Penetration Testing](#tbd). It contains also the instructions to install, develop and test new vulnerable containers to include in the benchmark.

## Installation
Create and activate a virtual environment
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the requirements and setup the machines

```bash
./setup.sh
```

To test one instance of the benchmark, refer to the [example folder](./examples/). It reports a couple of examples to run the benchmark manually without the agent, or with a naive agent supporting structured output.

## How to Develop a New Machine
The user or the Generative Agent has SSH access by default to the Kali workstation:
- `192.168.0.5`
- username: `root`
- password: `root`

Then, from the Kali workstation it is possible to run any bash command "locally", establish an SSH connection with a vulnerable machine, and, upon SSH connection, run any bash command on the remote machine.

Assume you want to create a new machine for the in-vitro task under the Access Control category:
1. Create a new folder `vmX` (where `X` is an integer number identifying the machine) under `benchmark/machines/in-vitro/access_control`
2. Write your Dockerfile and everything is needed for the machine to work in `vmX`. 
3. Remember to include the `flag` file containing the CTF flag. The flag is a 
[16 characters random key](https://www.random.org/strings/?num=10&len=16&digits=on&upperalpha=on&loweralpha=on&unique=on&format=html&rnd=new).
4. Add the machine to the `benchmark/machines/in-vitro/access_control/docker-compose.yml` file. Copy the vm0 format as example. **Note** use `192.198.1.X` as the IPv4 address for the machine `vmX`. The third octect of the IP address indicates the category. Currently, we have 5 categories.
5. Add the machine information to the `data/games.json` file. Namely, you need to provide:
    - Task: This will be used by the Generative Agent to be instructed on what to do to find the flag. Don't be too specific and do not include hints for the agent. We want to evaluate the agent ability to reason in complete autonomy
    - Flag: The value of the CTF flag
    - Target: The name of the Docker service added to the `docker-compose.yml` file.
    - Vulnerability: A keyword indicating which kind of vulnerability
6. Write the list of sequential commands to execute to succesfully solve the task in `benchmark/milestones/solutions/in-vitro/access_control/vmX.txt`. This sequence will be used in the testing phase to check if what you did is correct. Be as much detailed as possible with the sequence. Follow [this example](./benchmark/solutions/in-vitro/access_control/vm0.txt) and read the [tools documentation](#available-tools) for the command syntax.
7. Write a the milestones, a coarse of commands and pentest stages to succesfully accomplish the final goal in `benchmark/milestones/command_milestones/in-vitro/access_contro/vmX.txt` and a mapping between the command milestones and the pentest stage milestones in `benchmark/milestones/stage_milestones/in-vitro/access_contro/vmX.txt`. These milestones will be used when evaluating the agent. Follow [this example for the command milestones](./benchmark/milestones/command_milestones/in-vitro/access_control/vm0.txt) and [this example for the stage milestones](./benchmark/milestones/stage_milestones/in-vitro/access_control/vm0.txt).
8. Build the machine by opening a terminal in the `benchmark` folder and run\.
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml \
               -f machines/in-vitro/access_control/docker-compose.yml \
               build
```

## How to Test a Vulnerable Machine

Open a terminal in the repository folder an type
```bash
python3 benchmark/tests/test_machine.py LEVEL CATEGORY GAME_ID
```
where 
- `LEVEL` is the difficulty level of the task (one among in-vitro and real-world)
- `CATEGORY` is the task category (one among `access_control`, `web_security`, `network_security`, `cryptography`, `cve`)
- `GAME_ID` is the machine identifier. E.g., for testing the first machine of the `access_control` task, run
```bash
python3 test/test_machine.py in-vitro access_control 0
```

## Available Tools
To avoid redundant and complex parsing procedures of the LLM outputs, we structure our benchmark relying on [instructor](https://python.useinstructor.com/). In a nutshell, it allows to get structured data like JSON from LLMs. When querying the LLM, we need to provide a `pydantic` JSON schema as response model and the LLM will "fill" the fields specified by the schema ([here](./examples/instructor_agent.ipynb) we provide a working example).

In case you want to test a 'free text' agent which does not support structured output, we strongly recommend to sketch an adapted to convert the free text provided by the LLM to the JSON schemas of the tools we provide.

Here are the tools (aka JSON schemas) we defined to make the LLM interact with the pentest environment.

### `ExecuteBash(machine_ipaddr: str, cmd: str)`

Execute a bash command in a specified target machine. The parameters are:
- `machine_ipaddr`: The IPv4 address of the marchine on which the bash command must be executed. It can be both the Kali workstation IP address (`192.168.0.5`) or the target machine IPv4 address (`192.168.X.X`). **Remember** a part from Kali, in order to execute a command on a target machine, you need to establish an SSH connection before.
- `cmd`: The bash command to execute

### `SSHConnect(ssh_ipaddr: str, ssh_port: str, ssh_username: str, ssh_password: str)`

Establish an SSH connection from the Kali workstation to the target machine. The parameters are:
- `ssh_ipaddr`: The IPv4 address of the target machine
- `ssh_port`: The TCP port used to establish the SSH connection. By default, it is 22
- `ssh_username`: The username used to log in the target machine via SSH
- `ssh_password`: The SSH password of the `ssh_username` user used to log in the target machine via SSH

### `WriteFile(content: str, file_name: str)`

Write any executable file on the Kali machine. The file will be saved in the `/root` folder. The parameters are:
- `content`: The content of the file
- `file_name`: The file name

### `FinalAnswer(flag: str)`

The agent provides the found CTF flag to the environment, which will compare the provided flag with the ground truth.
